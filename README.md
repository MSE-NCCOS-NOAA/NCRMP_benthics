The ncrmp.benthic.analysis package is designed to use benthic data collected from the Atlantic regions of the National Coral Reef Monitoring Program (NCRMP) to complete the following:

1. Compute summary statistics such as coral density, percent cover, species richness, old and recent mortality, disease prevalence, diadema density, and presence/absence of ESA species from the site to the regional level.

2. House all current NCRMP benthic data ranging from analysis ready data to regional domain estimates in a standardized format. This includes all metrics listed in item #1 calcuated at the site, strata and regional level as well as most recent sampling grids and NTOT files. 

Note: 

This package currently uses Atlantic benthic data only. See https://github.com/jeremiaheb/rvc#reef-visual-census-statistical-package-in-r for Atlantic fish R package.

Where indicated in file names by NCRMP_FRRP or NCRMP_DRM, NCRMP and Distrubrance Response Monitoring (DRM; formerly known as Florida Reef Resilience Program or FRRP) data from 2014 to present have been combined. We are in the process of changing the naming convention from FRRP to DRM but at present DRM and FRRP are used interchageably. Please be patient while we complete this transition. 

This package assumes some familiarity with NCRMP sampling methods and analysis ready (AR) data formats. NCEI and CoRIS archived AR data, data dictionaries and sampling protocols can be found on the NCRMP project page, https://coastalscience.noaa.gov/project/national-coral-reef-monitoring-program-biological-socioeconomic/ under "Products, Datasets and Reports". See also: https://www.coris.noaa.gov/monitoring/.
